TODO:

- [ ] Brute force variant of "1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings"
- [ ] Look at other variants of solution to "392. Is Subsequence"
- [ ] Look at the "Approach #1 Cumulative Sum" approach to "643. Maximum Average Subarray I" (this is less space efficient than my actual solution, but good to understand nonetheless)
